## Description 
This Project is designed to parctice working with Regex(Regular expression)
In this project we wrote a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password
string it is passed is strong. A strong password is defined as one that
is at least eight characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase
characters, and has at least one digit.
